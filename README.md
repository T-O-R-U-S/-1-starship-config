# -1-starship-config

The best Starship config in all of existence! Objectively. ***Do not dispute it.***

## Setup

1) Run the `./build.zsh` script upon cloning the repo into your older, ***inferior*** config :)
2) Hail me for gracing you with the ***superior Starship config***!

## Why use Rust?

I hate bash. I do not want to learn bash. I am afraid of bash. Rust is good. Rust is comfort. Rust is life. Rust is Rust :crab:

Oh, I should mention that there is no Windows support because I hardcoded the home directory :) :rocket::rocket::rocket::crab::crab::crab:
